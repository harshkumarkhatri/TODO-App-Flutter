## Introduction 📌

If you are in a field where you want to manage your day to task and keep a track of which ones are done, then you might need something which could make your life easier.

If you have used G-mail then you might have noticed the task section which google provides in gmail where you can add your tasks and remove them once done.

Taking inspiration from that i have created a TODO app where you can add your daily task, edit them/update them and mark them completed once done.

## Technology Stack 🏁

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [SQFlite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite)

## Why this Project? 🏃‍♂️

This project is something which i personally think can help people manage their day to day tasks.

One thing which makes this app different is that you will have the track of when the task was added, updated and completed with the help of which you can get an estimate of how much time you took for completing that task.

For this project, i have worked on "Data Storage with SQFlite in multiple tables in Local storage" domain.
